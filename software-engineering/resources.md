### Stuff That Personally Worked for Me (Arshia)

Keep in mind that your mileage may vary. There's no one true way to do well in programming interviews :)

* A small amount of incremental practice a day. I got into the habit if doing 1-2 questions per week during co-op, so by the time my study term came up, I was more or less prepared to interview.
* Making a repository of programming questions I’d solved. This is a useful reference for when you want to prep right before an interview.
* Making a [repository](https://github.com/arshiamufti/quick-language-references) of language references for common things that I frequently have to do - this especially counts if your interview involves compiling/running code
